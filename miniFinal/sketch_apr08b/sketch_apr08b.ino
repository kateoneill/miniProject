/*Sound Sensor
 A simple program demonstrate sound sensor senses a sound that is up to the threshold you set
 in the code, the LED is on for 1s.
 
 The circuit:
 * sig pin of the sound sensor to the analog pin 24 (J6 plug on Grove Base BoosterPack)
 * one side pin (either one) to ground
 * the other side pin to +VCC
 * LED anode (long leg) attached to RED_LED
 * LED cathode (short leg) attached to ground
 
 * Note:   
 
 
 This example code is in the public domain.
